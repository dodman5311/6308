Every time you go without delivering souls, Drav gets hungrier and weaker, and your max health is reduced by 1.

If you refuse to deliver souls while your max health is at 1, Drav will die and you will be forced to play the rest of the game with 1 health and souls disabled.

However, every time you deliver souls, your max health will increase by 1 (Not going over 5).
