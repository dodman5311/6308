		Catagory = "Bosses",
		Entry = [[In Prima Hominum, also known as the Suburbs, three Laws were established:

1. Those fueled by violence must refrain when in a house of peace.

2. Those seeking the soul of another must acquire it through combat and no other means.

3. Those born of iron shall remain of iron.

To uphold these laws, three keepers were chosen: Maxum, host of Galga; Elios, host of Trovet; and Deilos, host of Kan-Esmortem. Over time, more laws were added, and more keepers appointed. However, the demons of Prima Hominum grew discontent. They despised the increasing restrictions and believed the freedom of Prima Hominum was rapidly diminishing. Something had to be done.

The opposing demons conspired to eliminate the keepers and abolish the laws. They united to kill the keepers, striking them down one by one, but Deilos remained. His strength and unwavering faith preserved him, allowing him to uphold the third and final law.

Deilos, feeling the weight of his fallen comrades, fell into great sorrow. He donned a mask made from the metals of their armor and swore to never remove it.

Recognizing his strength and great faith, the Iron Gate claimed him as her champion. She granted him power beyond his demon's foresight and crafted a new suit of armor for him, forged from the very metal of her dominion.

That day, Deilos was solidified as the final keeper—the Keeper of the Third Law.]],

		Catagory = "Bosses",
		Entry = [[Phillip is the first Everlasting. 
His will to survive is beyond that of any other host in existence, even to this day. He has bested every foe and every being he’s encountered. 
Unlike others, he has even bested the demon inside, gaining full control over his spiritual power.

Phillip has been fighting and thriving for over 400 years. He is seen as the ever-standing pillar of an otherwise dead world, but nothing is truly everlasting in this place of blood and iron.]],

	["Specimen #09"] = {
		Catagory = "Bosses",
		Entry = [[Specimen #09 was found at the center of the sewers in some kind of containment chamber. Little to nothing is known about what he is or what he can do. Anything that enters the chamber never returns. The people of the sewers simply avoid this chamber at all costs, fearing imminent death.

You could call this place the Bermuda Triangle of the sewers.]],

	["Visage Of False Hope"] = {
		Catagory = "Bosses",
		Entry = [[Upon the creation of the first law, Bruce watched helplessly as his body, alongside his son, committed unspeakable acts of carnage. Desperate to avoid punishment, Bruce pleaded with the demon within him to stop the madness and spare him and his child, but his cries went unheard.

In time, Bruce, his son, and the demon were banished to the sewers for defying the Iron Gate’s Order. Bruce endured unimaginable suffering, witnessing his child's torment and eventual ruin.
The demon, seeing his brother’s vessel, Bruce's son, broken and lame, decided it was time for him to find a new host. 
Bruce pleaded once again, and once again his pleas fell on deaf ears as the demon stripped his son of life and consumed his soul. 

Broken and without hope, Bruce struck a deal with the demon: he would surrender entirely, but only if the demon became a symbol of hope and order in the sewers.

The demon agreed, but Bruce was unaware of its true power. Manifesting its full form, the demon twisted Bruce's body into a grotesque tower of ego, pride, and sickness. This abomination compelled all in the sewers to follow it, growing ever more powerful by consuming its followers. Bruce, now a mere remnant, was left hanging from the creature's face, forced to witness his grave mistake.

The followers of this new entity called it the Stone God, while others knew it as the Visage of False Hope. 
The Stone God spread a prophecy: when all beings surrendered to it, the Iron Gate would fall, and the underworld would rise to claim the surface.]],

	["The Suburbs"] = {
		Catagory = "Areas",
		Entry = [[Prima Hominum, also known as the Suburbs, is the largest and most prosperous society inhabited by the possessed. It is considered the capital of the possessed territories.

Unlike other possessed areas, Prima Hominum had laws established by the Iron Gate herself. These laws were meant to reduce the amount of killing, ensuring souls remained bountiful. 
However, recently, violence has been escalating in the Suburbs, and the survival of common people dwindles every day.

Now is the time to make a change.]],
	},

	["The Sewers"] = {
		Catagory = "Areas",
		Entry = [[After the creation of the first law in the Suburbs, demons who were too violent or could not live without unchecked anarchy were sentenced to live in the sewers below.

The sewers quickly became a place of banishment for any demons too bloodthirsty for the Suburbs. While the Suburbs banished and forgot, life in the sewers continued. Violence, carnage, and pain thrived, as there was nothing else to be witnessed among the spirits below.

These demons would warp and mold their hosts, taking on more grotesque and broken forms to wreak havoc more effectively, combining their flesh with the metal around them and the hate within them.

After a few years, the Suburbs no longer considered the sewers as banishment, but as execution. No one sent to the sewers was ever seen again.]],
	},

	------------- Enemies -------------

	["Lunatic"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[The weakest form of possession occurs when a weak demon comes across an unwilling host and forces the host's mind to break so they can take control, resulting in a lunatic. This nonexistent relationship and the demon's weakness lead to an extremely feeble possession and host.

After breaking the host, the demon dons an Iron mask, symbolizing the host's lack of control and their new identity as the demon's physical body.]],
	},

	["Citizen"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[The second most common form of possession is known as a Citizen. This occurs when a weak demon finds a willing host.

The relationship between the demon and host means the host does not need to be broken. They usually give up control to the demon, leading to a stronger possession than that of a lunatic.

However, the Iron mask is still worn due to the lack of control by the willing host.]],
	},

	["Militant"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[An abandoned grunt from the Iron Unit. Militants were deployed among the suburbs to maintain order while the Iron Unit was away. 

Unfortunately, while the militants were told of the Iron Unit's eventual return, they were deceived. The Iron Unit abandoned them to die amid the chaos.
Despite this betrayal, the militants remain loyal to the Iron Gate. They still believe in the third and final law.]],
	},

	["Divine"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[<font color="#FF7800"><b>Shoot their head off for extra damage.</b></font>
		
A divine occurs when a broken host finds true peace in the will of the Iron Gate. They accept their new reality and work with their demon to transcend humanity. 
Their broken origins lead their new form to be stronger, yet still riddled with flaws and weaknesses.

This transformation usually occurs in militants, as their lifestyle glorifies the new dark regime and makes it easier for them to accept it.]],
	},

	["Everlasting"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[<font color="#FF7800"><b>Shoot their heart for extra damage.</b></font>
		
An Everlasting is created when a weak demon is overpowered by its host's undying will to survive.

The host breaks the weak demon and uses its power to strengthen their own will to survive. This results in Everlastings having vitality beyond any other possessed.

Their very existence stems from their unwavering belief in not dying.]],
	},

	["Paladin"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[<font color="#FF7800"><b>After a few shots, paladins will reload. try to attack while they are reloading.</b></font>
		
A paladin is a host who not only has a strong relationship with their demon but was also chosen by the Iron Gate to carry out her will. They are clad in metal from the Gate and equipped with weapons of the Iron Unit.

Their divine role results in constant protection from the Iron Gate and strength from the demon within.

They will not waver, they will not crumble until their light fades.]],
	},

	["Resident"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[A resident is a host who is still fighting the pestilence within the sewers, trying their best to survive their banishment.

They make great efforts to keep their mind and body clear from the infection of blood and pain. Even though they remain free of this infectious violence, they must still fight for survival.]],
	},

	["Pestilent"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[The Pestilent are those afflicted by the Red Sickness.
Their minds are stricken with false hope, and their bodies are slowly consumed by hateful malice. They are formed of rage and brutality, no longer composed of natural flesh.

Even in the early stages of this infection, their fight is futile. They will ultimately be consumed by the sickness, and their minds will be lost to the Visage.]],
	},

	["Tollsman"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[The Tollsman represent the piteous final stage of the Red Sickness. 
Their flesh is consumed, their minds broken and lost. Their entire being is surrendered to the Visage of Hope.

They now roam the sewers, adorned with the tools of a hopeful ceremony, tolling for the Visage so that all may witness his infinite power and infectious hope.]],
	},

	["Dreadful"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[The Dreadful are the result of a horrid, abhorrent demon taking over the flesh of its host. While not necessarily strong, these demons harbor a hateful will unseen by many in the land of the living.

They infect, corrupt, and destroy the mind and body of their host, warping and combining their flesh with metal to protect their unholy form. They spew explosive bile infused with burning chemicals and a hateful intent.

These creatures are the heart of the sewers, embodying its brutal nature.]],
	},

	["Sentinel"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[The appearance of the Sentinel is shrouded in mystery. It seems that whatever these large automatons were created for, it was likely of a protective nature.

Covered in heavy armor and equipped with destructive weaponry, Sentinels act as the protectors of the Sewers, attacking any newcomers, especially those approaching the Visage.

These machines further solidified the view of "sewer punishment" among the suburbs as a death sentence rather than mere banishment.]],
	},

	["Specimen"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[<font color="#FF7800"><b>Try to get around it, and shoot it's back for extra damage</b></font>
		
Much like its younger counterpart, the Sentinel, the Specimen is another creation shrouded in mystery. Once introduced, it became clear that the Sentinel was merely a prototype for this much more devastating concept.

Unlike the Sentinel, the Specimen is not only mechanical; it is half man, half machine. However, there is no human left within the metal cage of its mind.

The Specimen was designed to exert complete control over the world's gravitational forces, capable of pushing, pulling, and crushing its foes.

Despite its differences, the Specimen still serves as a protector, but of the Visage rather than the Sewers. It usually remains close to him, defending against anyone deemed a threat to his glory.]],
	},

	["Ghoul"] = {
		Catagory = "Enemies",
		Entry = [[<font color="#FF7800"><b>Walk backwards to avoid the goul's attacks. Shoot it's heart for an insta kill </b></font>
		
A thing of nightmares, the Ghoul is cursed to walk the fragile thread between the physical and the theoretical. 
It holds its essence within its chest, allowing it to break through the wall of reality. At no point does the Ghoul recognize its plane of existence or its origin. It only knows that it must kill and feed on both soul and flesh to survive.

This is a creature of madness and brutality. There is no mercy in the likes of a Ghoul.]],

	------------- Weapons -------------

	["Cleanse & Repent"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[A pair of M45A1 Pistols, the most common pistols found in the Suburbs.

After obtaining the left from a downed lunatic and the right from a church of refuge, you named them Cleanse & Repent. This marked the beginning of your path—to cleanse the world and make those who participated in its destruction repent.

They will be by your side to the end, whether in victory or beyond the dark veil of death.]],
	},
	["Double Shot"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[A simple double-barreled shotgun.

Invented in 1875, it has been a staple of reliability and destructive power for decades. Its use in the year 3000 shows no signs of decreasing.

While it takes some time to reload, it's more than enough for you to get the job done.]],
	},

	["Quad Shot"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[The Liberator Shotgun was designed by Robert Hillberg in 1962. At the time, the public didn't see the weapon as necessary, but Robert was clearly ahead of his time.

By the year 3000, the demand for an excessively destructive, quad-barreled shotgun had skyrocketed. 

Every man, woman, and child wanted this extreme weapon for either protection or devastating assault. In your case, it's the latter.]],
	},

	["Boom Cannon"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[The Boom Cannon is a modified version of the Desert Eagle .50 AE pistol. Unlike its predecessor, the Boom Cannon is chambered in .50 RE, also known as the .50 Regretfull Endeavor. This new round is infused with soul-crushing bile from a dreading spirit, causing searing damage to possessed hosts.

Due to this modification, the Boom Cannon can inflict bodily harm that the Desert Eagle cannot. 

This weapon quickly became a valuable commodity for combatants in the Black Age.]],
	},

	["BORUS"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[The BORUS assault rifle was designed by the Iron Unit as a standard-issue weapon. The name B.O.R.U.S stands for:

Battle
Operations &
Rapid
Urban
Suppression

After the fall of the 1st Keeper, violence in Prima Hominum escalated. The Iron Unit evacuated the area, declaring it a "lost cause." Some Unit technology was left behind during the evacuation, placing the BORUS in civilian hands.]],
	},

	["RIPP"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[The R.I.P.P., created by Aztac, was initially developed to test Weaponized Unstable Plasma. This project was nicknamed "the Big Wup."

It began as a venture into developing a new type of weapon for the US military. The project was successful, and the Really Intuitive Plasma Pistol was submitted to the military for testing. However, the military found no need for such weaponry since it was, ironically, neither intuitive nor easy to control.

The project was abandoned, and the product was left in the dust. That was until the beginning of the Crusade. The weapon prototype was rediscovered and adopted as a method to combat the possessed. While the R.I.P.P. didn’t secure victory for the humans in the Crusade, it gained popularity afterward for its rapid destructive power.]],
	},

	["I-Six"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[<font color="#FF7800"><b>Hold fire to build up lock ons. Every 2 locks reduces the damage by 1.</b></font>
		
The I-Six has a mysterious origin, discovered around 2895 during a drug raid in Muerta Crista by NADA. Aztac purchased the weapon from authorities for its revolutionary automatic aiming and adversary detection technology.

Aztac conducted extensive research and development on the weapon, transforming it into a fully commercial product named the I-Six. Marketed as a civilian home defense weapon, it quickly gained popularity.

Although the I-Six’s ability to lock onto multiple targets when the trigger is held was initially seen as dangerous and unnecessary, it became highly valued during the Black Age.

The success of the I-Six served as the foundation for Aztac's subsequent smart weapon developments.]],
	},

	["Katana"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[<font color="#FF7800"><b>Right click to parry</b></font>
		
Created in Japan during the Nanboku-cho period, the Katana is a single-edged masterpiece of a weapon. While it can be quite brittle, it more than compensates with its exceptional slicing prowess.

Despite its lack of popularity in the Black Age, it still sees some use by dedicated swordsmen and cosplayers. 

Which one are you? That question has yet to be answered.]],
	},

	["Harpoons"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[Harpoons are the poor man's weapon of the sewers. Introduced in the early stages of sewer habitation, they were scavenged from scraps and bodies found on the surface and in the sewers alike.

While not heavily demanded, harpoons still see some minor use by those desperate for any kind of weapon to defend themselves, or crazy enough to use a giant spike as a viable method of combat. 

You most likely reside in the second group.]],
	},

	["Drill Bite"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[The Drill Bite is more of a weapon cocktail. It combines an 1892 Mare’s Leg with a Gauntlet of Holy Iron.

The Mare’s Leg is a lever-action shotgun developed by Kenny "Von Dutch" Howard. This weapon is chosen for its devastating shotgun rounds, one-handed capability, and ease of aiming.

The gauntlet is forged from a mixture of steel and the broken iron of the 1st Keeper’s armor. This iron was obtained after the 1st Keeper’s grave was defiled by a Pestilent seeking a holy power to cure his illness. While the divine metal did not cure the Pestilent’s illness, others found use for it in crafting nearly indestructible pieces of armor.

Although there was not enough of this alloy to produce entire suits, there was enough to create gauntlets for minor protection. Once these gauntlets were produced, they were naturally paired with the Mare’s Leg, creating the deadly combination known as the Drill Bite.]],
	},

	["800M"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[The 800M was an experimental weapon developed by the Iron Unit as a heavy ordnance tool for personnel. Its primary purpose was to hold back overwhelming threats until reinforcements could arrive.

Despite its powerful rocket-propelled projectiles, the 800M was quickly abandoned by the Iron Unit due to its overcomplexity, unreliability, inaccuracy, and punishing recoil. Though the Unit had prematurely ordered over 90,000 of these rifles, they ultimately discarded them.

The sewer residents, however, were unfazed by these flaws. Drawn to the explosive firepower, they eagerly adopted the 800M, embracing its destructive potential despite its drawbacks.

Explosive boollet + awesome = sewer people take.]],
	},

	["Cutter"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[Much like the Harpoons, the Cutter is a basic handheld saw with all safety systems removed. It was introduced early in the days of sewer habitation when residents scrambled to arm themselves with whatever they could find. 

The Cutter quickly became a weapon of choice due to its accessibility and lethal simplicity.]],
	},

	["Bull Shot"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[The Bull Shot is a break-action, single-shot explosive shotgun pistol, cobbled together from spare parts of broken 800M rifles. It was devised as a way to salvage materials from an already formidable weapon, though the result was a slightly less effective firearm.

Desperate sewer residents primarily use the Bull Shot for long-range defense when confronting powerful foes, making it a makeshift but essential tool in their struggle for survival.]],
	},

	["Gratana"] = {
		Catagory = "Weapons",
		Entry = [[<font color="#FF7800">Saw blades will stick into enemies until they die.</font>
The Gratana is a saw blade launcher equipped with trajectory-adjusting technology, capable of firing blades with deadly precision. 
This weapon is a mosaic of parts, combining components from the BORUS, the I-Six, and modified blades from the Cutter.

Much like the Sentinels, the creator of the Gratana remains unknown. The weapon appeared shortly after the Sentinels, quickly becoming a favorite among sewer residents for its ability to slice through multiple adversaries with a single shot.

A truly devastating weapon, in the hands of a truly devastating being.]],

When the Iron Gate opened, these spirits began flowing out and filling the world. Despite being in a physical realm, they had no physical bodies.

Needing souls to survive, they would possess humans and make them kill each other to consume the souls of their carnage.

These spirits were nicknamed "Demons" by those who experienced their touch, and those people were named "The Possessed."]],

Qiosk even offers power to customers in exchange for one of his patented <font color="#FF7800">Perk Tickets.</font> 
		
Being one of the few physical demons in existence, Qiosk often hides behind his protected stands to avoid death at the hands of a ravenous host.

However, Qiosk still places a sign so his customers can always find him: <font color="#FF7800">"Look for the blue light."</font>]],

With the growing violence in the suburbs, vending machines offering weaponry to commoners were introduced. These machines were constructed and produced by a demon named Qiosk, who hoped to further his business venture amidst the ongoing carnage.

However, they possess a severe design flaw. Certain forms of dramatic blunt force trauma can cause them to dispense weapons without payment. For instance, if someone were to throw a heavy object at one—such as a weapon—it would dispense its contents.]],
